I use wget -rkpN -e robots=off http://www.example.com/

-r means recursively

-k means convert links. So links on the webpage will be localhost instead of example.com/bla

-p means get all webpage resources so obtain images and javascript files to make website work properly.

-N is to retrieve timestamps so if local files are newer than files on remote website skip them.

-e is a flag option it needs to be there for the robots=off to work.

robots=off means ignore robots file.

I also had -c in this command so if they connection dropped if would continue where it left off from when i re-run the command. I figured -N would go well with -c
