#   This will mean that the domain is limited to 50mb bandwidth (52428800), 
#   that it can only have 400 connections at once and 
#   that any files over 1mb will be limited to 200kb/s (204800).
#   For anyone reading this later you can also put an extension instead 
#   of * to limit just zips,rars,avis or whatever.
